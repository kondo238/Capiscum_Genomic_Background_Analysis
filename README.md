***Summary of this paper*** **:** In this paper, we aimed to clarify the genetic background of the Nepalese landrace chili pepper Dalle Khursani (tetraploid and alloploid: 2n = 2x = 48). For this analysis, we designed an approach to characterize the derivation of the genomic fragments called 'stacks', based on commonality of their existence and sequences with five *Capsicum* species (*C.annuum*, *C.chinense*, *C.frutescens*, *C.baccatum*, *C.pubescens*). Finally, we revealed that almost all stacks that existed in Dalle Khursani were derived from *C.annuum* and *C.chinense*. Finally, we concluded Dalle Khursani was tetraploid, derived from both *C*. *annuum* and *C*. *chinense*
