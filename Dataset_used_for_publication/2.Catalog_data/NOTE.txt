This directory includes two files below.

1. Catalog_dataset.csv.zip: Catalog dataset file processed from populations.haplotypes.tsv.zip. This file contains genotypes at all catalogs detected in all samples, which are necessary for "catalog existence-based stacks characterization" in the genomic background analysis.

1. Reference_array.csv.zip: subset of the catalog dataset. This file contains genotypes only for six reference accessions in each five Capsicum species, which are necessary for "catalog existence-based stacks characterization" in the genomic background analysis.
