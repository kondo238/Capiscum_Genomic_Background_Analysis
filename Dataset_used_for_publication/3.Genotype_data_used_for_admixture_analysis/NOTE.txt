This directory includes the four files below.

1. 1.Dalle_Khursani.zip: frozen directory including genotypes data for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common catalogs, C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in Dalle Khursani(Six lines)-possessing catalogs. This directory includes four directories ('1.C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common', '2.C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common', '3.C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common') for each catalog group. These directories respectively included the genotype data (dataset.ped) and map data (dataset.map), which are necessary for further ADMIXTURE analysis.

2. 2.C.annuum_positive_control.zip: frozen directory including genotypes data for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common catalogs, C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in C. annuum(positive control six accessions)-possessing catalogs. This directory includes three directories ('1.C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common', '2.C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common') for each catalog group. These directories respectively included the genotype data (dataset.ped) and map data (dataset.map), which are necessary for further ADMIXTURE analysis.

3. 3.C.chinense_positive_control.zip: frozen directory including genotypes data for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common catalogs, C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in C. chinense(positive control six accessions)-possessing catalogs. This directory includes three directories ('1.C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common', '3.C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common') for each catalog group. These directories respectively included the genotype data (dataset.ped) and map data (dataset.map), which are necessary for further ADMIXTURE analysis.

4. 4.C.frutescens_positive_control.zip: frozen directory including genotypes data for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in C. chinense(positive control six accessions)-possessing catalogs. This directory includes three directories ('2.C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common', '3.C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common') for each catalog group. These directories respectively included the genotype data (dataset.ped) and map data (dataset.map), which are necessary for further ADMIXTURE analysis.
