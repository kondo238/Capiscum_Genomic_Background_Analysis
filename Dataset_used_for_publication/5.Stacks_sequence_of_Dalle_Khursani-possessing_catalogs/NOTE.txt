This directory includes one directory and the five files below.

# Directory
1. catalog.tags.tsv: This directory includes three split (catalog.tags.tsv.split1.gz, catalog.tags.tsv.split2.gz, catalog.tags.tsv.split3.gz) files of stacks sequence data obtained by stacks analysis using all samples. The merged data was used to develop below FASTA files. 

#Files
1. C.annuum-derived_stacks.fa.zip: Sequence data (.fa) of stacks at C.annuum-derived catalogs.

2. C.chinense-derived_stacks.fa.zip: Sequence data (.fa) of stacks at C.chinense-derived catalogs.

3. C.annuum_and_C.chinense-derived_stacks.fa.zip: Sequence data (.fa) of stacks at C.annuum & C.chinense-derived catalogs.

4. C.annuum_and_C.chinense-derived_stacks.fa.zip: Sequence data (.fa) of stacks at the other catalogs.

5. Genomic_positions_of_mappable_stacks.csv.zip: Genomic position data for mappable stacks in Dalle Khursani-possessing catalogs to C. annuum ('Takanotsume', Shirasawa et al. 2023) and C. chinense genome (Zhang et al. 2025), respectively.
