This directory includes the four files below.

1. 1.Dalle_Khursani.zip: frozen directory including output data of Admixture analysis (Attribution proportion) for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common catalogs, C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in Dalle Khursani(Six lines)-possessing catalogs. This directory includes four directories ('1.C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common', '2.C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common', '3.C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common'). These directories respectively include the output data 'Admixture_analysis_result.csv', which is necessary for drawing figures for attribution proportion in ADMIXTURE analysis.

2. 2.C.annuum_positive_control.zip: frozen directory including output data of Admixture analysis (Attribution proportion) for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common catalogs, C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in C.annuum(positive control six accessions)-possessing catalogs. This directory includes three directories ('1.C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common', '2.C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common'). These directories respectively include the output data 'Admixture_analysis_result.csv', which is necessary for drawing figures for attribution proportion in ADMIXTURE analysis.

3. 3.C.chinense_positive_control.zip: frozen directory including output data of Admixture analysis (Attribution proportion) for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common catalogs, C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in C.chinense(positive control six accessions) possessing catalogs. This directory includes three directories ('1.C.annuum_and_C.chinense-common', '3.C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common'). These directories respectively include the output data 'Admixture_analysis_result.csv', which is necessary for drawing figures for attribution proportion in ADMIXTURE analysis.

4. 4.C.frutescens_positive_control.zip: frozen directory including output data of Admixture analysis (Attribution proportion) for more than two species-common catalogs (C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common catalogs, and Three_species-common catalogs) in C.frutescens(positive control six accessions) possessing catalogs. This directory includes three directories ('2.C.annuum_and_C.frutescens-common', '3.C.chinense_and_C.frutescens-common', and '4.Three_spceies-common'). These directories respectively include the output data 'Admixture_analysis_result.csv', which is necessary for drawing figures for attribution proportion in ADMIXTURE analysis.
